Question:5 If you have lots of images of different types of plankton labeled with their species name, and lots of computational resources, what would you expect to perform better predictions:

Answer: a) a deep neural network trained on this data.


Question:6 If you have a few images of different types of plankton labeled with their species name, what would you expect to perform better predictions:

Answer: b) a simple classifier trained on this data, using deep features as input, which were trained using ImageNet data.
